Currently, there are limited client libraries available for Liftbridge.
However, Liftbridge uses gRPC for its client API, so low-level client libraries
can be generated quite easily using the [Liftbridge protobuf
definitions](https://github.com/liftbridge-io/liftbridge-grpc). See the [client
implementation guidance](client_implementation.md) documentation for help on
implementing a Liftbridge client library.

Available client libraries are listed below. Libraries with an asterisk are
official clients.

## Go

[go-liftbridge](https://github.com/liftbridge-io/go-liftbridge)*

## Node.js

[node-liftbridge](https://github.com/paambaati/node-liftbridge)

## Python
